===============

``fastmin`` provides implementations of the algorithms for
fast energy minimization described in [BOYKOV01]_: the alpha-expansion
and the alpha-beta-swap.

.. [BOYKOV01] *Fast approximate energy minimization via graph cuts.*
   Yuri Boykov, Olga Veksler and Ramin Zabih. TPAMI 2001.

Currently, the functions in this module are restricted to
grids with von Neumann neighborhood.
